# CS408 - M3.2 Lab
    For this lab, we are taking a blank txt file and adding format to it.

    This txt file will become a well formated letter involving many 
    different types of lists as well as easy readability.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    In order to view the pop ups you may have to enter into a webpage. If you are using 
    live extention you can copy the link and paste it into a web browser to test it


## Testing
    There is no tests for this project. As such there is no
    command to run them.
