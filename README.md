# CS408 - M3.2 Lab
    For this lab, we are taking a blank txt file and adding format to it.

    This txt file will become a well formated letter involving many 
    different types of lists as well as easy readability.

## Getting Started
    To get started, clone this repository, and then you can learn 
    to view it in the "Viewing" section. Which is below.

## Viewing
    I highly recommend using VSCode Live Server extention to see the project. This allows you to
    see the page, and interact with the page without having to open it in a local file.

    The file that you will be looking at for this project in my github is called Letter.html
    
## Testing
    There is no tests for this project. As such there is no
    command to run them.

## More Info
    There is an extra file you have access to in this github, 
    it's called "Raw.txt" this file is the copy paste version 
    that we were given and then I started formating it before 
    transfering it over to a the html letter.

    I did do the validation test and it did pass the document 
    checking, with no errors or warnings which is nice.
